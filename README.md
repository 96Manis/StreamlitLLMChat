I have crafted an interactive chatbot leveraging the Streamlit framework, a powerful tool for building web applications with Python. This chatbot is designed to engage users in natural language conversations. To enhance its language understanding, I've integrated a Language Model (LLM), allowing the chatbot to comprehend and respond to a wide array of user inputs with contextual understanding.

Additionally, I've employed FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for embedding purposes. FAISS is a powerful library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, which proves invaluable in enhancing the chatbot's ability to process and analyze textual data. By incorporating FAISS, the chatbot can efficiently retrieve and match embedded representations of textual information, resulting in a more sophisticated and context-aware conversational experience.
